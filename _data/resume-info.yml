about:
  - about-me: I am someone that lives life to the fullest and someone that is always striving for the best. Life has hit me with so many challenges and at these different points in time I had to become someone else entirely, I had to learn new things, I had to apply those things to the projects I am currently working on and other life happenings. I had to make these new experiences parts of me. What I become at certain times, becomes the person I am now. With the ever evolving technology we need to keep evolving, that is exactly what I am. <strong>Ever Evolving.</strong>
